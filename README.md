# nfs2iso2nfs
Convert nfs files to iso and back

## This Branch
* Overhauled to .Net 6
* Written as a Class Library instead of a Console App with a focus of moving over to Objects and Helpers
* Added support to run it as a Console App with similar performance, there will be different information written out to the console
* Added simple Unit Tests for the Helper functions
